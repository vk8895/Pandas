PyCitySchools Data Trends Summary:

1) Charter vs. District (Charter performance much greater in math/reading)
The obvious trend here is that charter schools have a much higher overall passing% rate than district schools, 90% to 53%.
One related trend I saw was that the smaller size schools (<2000 students) also scored higher, leading me to believe that
charter schools are smaller. Upon verification of summary 1 vs. summary 2 in Task #9, this proved true. Charter school average 
size is 1524, whereas district school average size is 3854 students. The trend is clear, but which way is it...smaller schools perform better than larger schools at math/reading (90% to 53% passing rate)
but is it b/c they are smaller or is it because they are charter schools w/ modified curriculums/teaching methods etc?

2) Per Student Budget (The higher the per student budget, the lower the math/reading performance)
Seems like schools with less per student spend, <$584 scored better overall on passing rate than schools that spend more on students.
Judging by the above, district schools tended to be >2x the size of charter schools, yet their spending per spending per student 
averages >$630 per student whereas charter schools are <=$600 per student...leading to another question, is it that less per
student spending is actually beneficial, or is it that district schools just spend their money less efficiently?
